## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Mitigation

**Issue:** ode quality concerns from community
- **Mitigation:** nsure %+ test coverage, comprehensive docs, active issue responses

**Issue:** onfusion with proprietary offerings
- **Mitigation:** lear documentation about open vs commercial, friendly messaging

**Issue:** ompeting with established libraries
- **Mitigation:** ocus on unified PI, better integration, executive-grade outputs

**Issue:** Maintainer burnout
- **Mitigation:** uild contributor community early, automate I/, clear contribution guidelines

**Issue:** Security vulnerabilities discovered
- **Mitigation:** SURITY.md with clear reporting process, fast patch releases

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered after launch:

. **Immediate ctions:**
   - [ ] Tag current state as v.. (bugfix)
   - [ ] Identify and fix critical issue
   - [ ] Run full test suite
   - [ ] Publish hotfix to PyPI

2. **ommunication:**
   - [ ] Post issue on GitHub with explanation
   - [ ] Tweet about fix being deployed
   - [ ] Update documentation if needed

3. **xtreme ase (Unpublish):**
   - [ ] ontact PyPI to remove package (requires justification)
   - [ ] Make repo private temporarily
   - [ ] ix issues thoroughly
   - [ ] Re-launch with v..2
