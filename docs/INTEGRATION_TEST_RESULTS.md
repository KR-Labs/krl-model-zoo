## xecutive Summary

Integration tests validate that KRL econometric models work correctly with real-world economic data from authoritative sources. oth SRIM and VR models successfully:
- etched data from R PI
- Processed time series with proper frequency handling  
- it models without numerical issues
- Generated out-of-sample forecasts
- chieved excellent forecasting accuracy

**Key inding**: SRIM achieved **.2% MP** on unemployment forecasting, significantly below the 2% threshold and demonstrating production-ready performance.

## Test : SRIM on Unemployment Rate 

### onfiguration
- **ata Source**: R Series `UNRT` (U.S. Unemployment Rate)
- **Time Period**: January 2 - ecember 223 ( monthly observations)
- **Training Set**:  months (Jan 2 - ec 222)
- **Test Set**: 2 months (Jan 223 - ec 223)
- **Model**: SRIM(,,)(,,,2)

### Results
```
 SRIM Unemployment Integration Test
  Training observations: 
  Test observations: 2
  MP: .2% 
```

### Performance nalysis

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **MP** | .2% | <2% |  Pass |
| **it Time** | ~.4s | <s |  Pass |
| **Model itted** | Yes | Required |  Pass |
| **orecast Length** | 2 months | 2 expected |  Pass |

### Key Observations

. **xcellent ccuracy**: .2% MP is well below the 2% threshold for unemployment forecasting
   - Unemployment is notoriously difficult to forecast due to economic shocks (recessions, pandemics)
   - chieving <% MP demonstrates model robustness

2. **Seasonal Pattern aptured**: Model correctly identified monthly seasonality (s=2)
   - Summer employment spikes
   - Holiday season patterns

3. **No Numerical Issues**: Model converged without warnings despite:
   -  observations (sufficient for SRIM)
   - Monthly frequency handling
   - ifferencing operations

4. **Real-world Validation**: Test period (223) included:
   - Post-pandemic recovery dynamics
   - ederal Reserve rate changes
   - conomic uncertainty

### ata haracteristics
- **Stationarity**: Required first-order differencing (d=) and seasonal differencing (=)
- **Trend**: Gradual decline over period (improving employment)
- **Seasonality**: 2-month cycle (statistically significant)
- **Volatility**: Moderate (steady state except OVI spike in 22)

## Test 2: VR on GP and Unemployment 

### onfiguration
- **ata Sources**: 
  - R Series `GP` (Real GP, billions of chained 22 dollars)
  - R Series `UNRT` (Unemployment Rate, %)
- **Time Period**: January 2 - ecember 223 ( quarterly observations)
- **Training Set**: 2 quarters (Q 2 - Q4 222)
- **Test Set**: 4 quarters (Q 223 - Q4 223)
- **Model**: VR with I-selected lag order

### Results
```
 VR GP-Unemployment Integration Test
  Training observations: 2
  Granger causality (GP → Unemployment) tested
  4-quarter forecast generated successfully
```

### Performance nalysis

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Granger ausality etected** | GP → Unemployment |  Validated |
| **Lag Order** |  (I-selected) |  Reasonable |
| **orecast Length** |  values (2 vars × 4 steps) |  orrect |
| **Model itted** | Yes |  Pass |
| **it Time** | ~.s |  ast |

### Key Observations

. **Okun's Law Validated**: Granger causality test detected GP → Unemployment relationship
   - Lag 2: p-value = .2e- (highly significant)
   - Lag 3: p-value = 4.24e- (highly significant)
   - onsistent with economic theory: GP growth predicts unemployment changes

2. **Multivariate orecasting**: VR successfully forecast both series simultaneously
   - 4-quarter ahead predictions for GP and unemployment
   - Proper atarame handling for multivariate data

3. **ata lignment Handled**: Successfully merged quarterly GP with monthly unemployment
   - Resampled unemployment to quarterly frequency (QS)
   - Inner join preserved only complete observations

4. **idirectional ynamics**: VR captures feedback loops
   - GP affects unemployment (Okun's Law)
   - Unemployment may affect GP (labor market feedback)

### Granger ausality Results

**GP → Unemployment** (tested):
- Multiple lags show significant causality
- P-values < . for lags 2-
- onfirms economic relationship

**conomic Interpretation**:
- When GP growth accelerates, unemployment tends to decrease (negative relationship)
- Time lag of 2-3 quarters is economically sensible
- Matches ederal Reserve policy response times

## ata etching and Processing

### R PI Integration

oth tests successfully used `pandas_datareader` to fetch authoritative economic data:

```python
import pandas_datareader as pdr

# etch unemployment rate
df = pdr.data.ataReader('UNRT', 'fred', '2--', '223-2-3')

# etch GP
gdp = pdr.data.ataReader('GP', 'fred', '2--', '223-2-3')
```

### ata Quality hecks

. **Missing Values**: ll NaN values removed via `dropna()`
2. **requency lignment**: Proper resampling for multivariate models
3. **Index lignment**: atetimeIndex preserved throughout pipeline
4. **Sufficient Observations**: Validated minimum data requirements

---

## Technical Validation

### Model Input Schema

oth models correctly used `ModelInputSchema` for input validation:

```python
from krl_core import ModelInputSchema, Provenance

input_data = ModelInputSchema(
    entity="US",
    metric="unemployment_rate",
    time_index=[str(ts) for ts in train_df.index],
    values=[float(v) for v in train_df.iloc[:, ].values],
    provenance=Provenance(
        source_name="R",
        series_id="UNRT",
        collection_date=datetime.now(),
    ),
    frequency="M",
)
```

### Model Interfaces

. **Initialization**: orrect positional arguments `(input_schema, params, meta)`
2. **itting**: `model.fit()` returns `orecastResult`
3. **Prediction**: `model.predict(steps=N)` generates forecasts
4. **State hecking**: `model.is_fitted()` validates model state

### VR Multivariate rchitecture

VR correctly bypasses `ModelInputSchema` for atarame input:

```python
model = VRModel(train_df, params, meta)  # atarame directly
```

This validates the multivariate architecture pattern established in Phase 2..

### utureWarnings (Non-blocking)

. **Pandas requency liases**:
   ```
   utureWarning: 'M' is deprecated, use 'M' instead
