# KR-Labs Model Zoo  

**Open-Source Socioeconomic Intelligence for a Better Future**

KR-Labs Model Zoo™ is an open, collaborative repository of socioeconomic models, tools, and tutorials designed to help researchers, policymakers, and organizations understand and respond to real-world challenges through data.  

This initiative bridges machine learning, public data, and human insight—turning complex social and economic signals into practical tools for equitable decision-making.  

---

## Purpose  

The Model Zoo exists to make **responsible, reproducible, and actionable analytics** accessible to everyone working toward economic resilience and social progress.  
We believe data science should empower—not obscure—public good.  

---

## What You Can Do  

- **Explore Real-World Use Cases:** Analyze housing affordability, labor markets, income trends, or health disparities.  
- **Build Insightful Models:** Use pre-built, transparent ML frameworks for forecasting, clustering, or causal inference.  
- **Visualize with Purpose:** Create interactive dashboards and visual narratives that communicate data with clarity.  
- **Collaborate and Contribute:** Share new models, tutorials, or datasets with a growing global community of analysts and researchers.  

---

## Why It Matters  

The KR-Labs Model Zoo is not just code—it’s a living ecosystem of public-interest intelligence.  
By combining open data with ethical AI, it enables:  

- **Evidence-based policy decisions** grounded in real data.  
- **Community research collaboration** across academia, government, and nonprofit sectors.  
- **Education and upskilling** in applied machine learning and responsible analytics.

# KRL Model Zoo  
**Open Models. Trusted Intelligence. Shared Progress.**

KRL Model Zoo™ is a modular, open-source framework for socioeconomic modeling—integrating econometric, machine learning, Bayesian, causal inference, and network analysis under one reproducible architecture.  
Developed by **KR-Labs**, the platform standardizes model creation, validation, and deployment for public-interest analytics.

---

## Mission  

We believe open intelligence should serve human progress.  
The Model Zoo provides the foundations for responsible, transparent, and reproducible modeling—used by data scientists, policymakers, and institutions to explore trends, test interventions, and forecast outcomes with confidence.  

---

## Core Capabilities  

- **Unified Architecture:** A common interface (`BaseModel`, `Result`, `Registry`) across all model families.  
- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic hashing, provenance tracking, and transparent metadata ensure identical reruns.  
- **Scalability:** Modular federation across econometric, causal, ML, Bayesian, and agent-based domains.  
- **Visualization:** Native Plotly adapters for standardized, interactive outputs.  
- **Community Collaboration:** Shared examples, curated datasets, and open contribution pathways.  

---

## Model Families  

- **Econometric Models:** ARIMA, VAR, Cointegration  
- **Causal Models:** DiD, IV, RCT, Synthetic Control  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks  
- **Bayesian Models:** PyMC-based hierarchical systems  
- **Network & Agent-Based Models:** System-level simulations of social and economic dynamics  

Each model is built for **lineage, interpretability, and trust**—balancing academic rigor with practical application.
