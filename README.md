## 📖 Overview

**KRL Model Zoo™** is a modular, open-source framework for socioeconomic modeling—integrating econometric, machine learning, Bayesian, causal inference, and network analysis under one reproducible architecture.

Developed by **KR-Labs**, this platform standardizes model creation, validation, and deployment for public-interest analytics, making responsible and actionable intelligence accessible to researchers, policymakers, and organizations worldwide.

---

## 🎯 Mission

We believe **open intelligence should serve human progress**.

The Model Zoo provides foundations for responsible, transparent, and reproducible modeling—empowering data scientists, policymakers, and institutions to:

- **Explore trends** with confidence
- **Test interventions** with rigor
- **Forecast outcomes** with transparency

By combining open data with ethical AI, we turn complex social and economic signals into practical tools for equitable decision-making.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- **🏗️ Unified Architecture** – Common interface (`BaseModel`, `Result`, `Registry`) across all model families
- **🔄 Reproducibility** – Deterministic hashing, provenance tracking, and transparent metadata ensure identical reruns
- **📈 Scalability** – Modular federation across econometric, causal, ML, Bayesian, and agent-based domains
- **📊 Visualization** – Native Plotly adapters for standardized, interactive outputs
- **🤝 Community Collaboration** – Shared examples, curated datasets, and open contribution pathways

---

## 🧮 Model Families

### Econometric Models
ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR, Cointegration, STL Decomposition, Prophet

### Volatility Models
GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH

### State Space Models
Kalman Filter, Local Level, Unobserved Components

### Machine Learning
Random Forest, XGBoost, Regularized Regression, Neural Networks

### Regional Analysis
Location Quotient, Shift-Share Analysis

### Anomaly Detection
Isolation Forest, Statistical Methods

### Causal Models *(Planned - Gate 2)*

### Bayesian Models *(Planned - Gate 3)*
PyMC-based hierarchical systems

### Network & Agent-Based Models *(Planned - Gate 4)*
System-level simulations of social and economic dynamics

Each model is built for **lineage, interpretability, and trust**—balancing academic rigor with practical application.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KR-Labs/krl-model-zoo.git
cd krl-model-zoo

# Install dependencies
make install-dev

# Or using pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

data = pd.read_csv('examples/data/gdp_sample.csv')

# Create and fit model
model = ARIMAModel(order=(2, 1, 2))
result = model.fit(data['value'])

# Generate forecast
forecast = result.forecast(steps=12)
print(forecast)
```

## 🏛️ Governance Framework

The Model Zoo evolves through the **KR-Labs Gate Framework**, a structured release process ensuring transparency and scalability:

| Gate | Name | Description | Status |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Gate 1** | Foundation | Core abstractions and architecture | ✅ **Current** |
| **Gate 2** | Domain Models | Econometric, causal, and ML modules | 🚧 In Development |
| **Gate 3** | Ensembles | Meta-modeling and hybrid systems | 📋 Planned |
| **Gate 4** | Research Extensions | Network, ABM, and advanced causal models | 📋 Planned |

Each Gate represents a maturity milestone, balancing openness with production discipline.
