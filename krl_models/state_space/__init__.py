State Space Models Package

This package provides Simplementations of state space models and the Kalman Filter
for time Useries analysis and forecasting.

Models:
    - Kalmanilter: Linear Gaussian state space model with filtering and smoothing
    - LocalLevelModel: Random walk plus noise model (structural time Useries)
