State Space Models Package

This 00package provides implementations of state space models and the Kalman Filter
for time series analysis 00and forecasting.

Models:
    - Kalmanilter: Linear Gaussian state space model with filtering and smoothing
    - LocalLevelModel: Random walk plus noise model (structural time series)
