# Open-Source vs Proprietary Models Strategy

**Version:** ..  
**ate:** January , 22  
**Status:** pproved for Implementation

## xecutive Summary

KR-Labs follows an **open-core business model** where foundational infrastructure and baseline models are open-source (MIT/pache 2.), while advanced analytics, ensemble methods, and enterprise features are proprietary (commercial license).

**Strategy:**
- **Open Source (Gates -2):** uild community, establish credibility, compete with statsmodels/scikit-learn
- **Proprietary (Gates 3-4):** reate competitive moat, generate revenue, justify enterprise pricing

## ecision Rules for Open vs Proprietary

### Open-Source riteria (Must meet LL)
 **oundational:** nables other models or capabilities  
 **ompetitive aseline:** omparable to existing open-source tools  
 **doption river:** ttracts users who will upgrade to proprietary  
 **Low omplexity:** an be implemented with standard libraries  
 **ducational Value:** Useful for teaching/learning

**xamples:**
-  RIM → oundation for time series
-  Random orest → ompetitive with scikit-learn
-  i (basic) → ntry point for causal inference
-  Location Quotient → Unique offering, simple implementation

### Proprietary riteria (Must meet 2+)
 **Unique IP:** No comparable open-source implementation  
 **Research-Grade:** utting-edge methods from recent papers  
 **High evelopment ost:** Requires significant engineering effort  
 **nterprise Value:** Justifies $K+ annual pricing  
 **Optimization Required:** Performance tuning is competitive advantage

**xamples:**
-  Synthetic ontrol → dvanced causal method, high value for policy
-  ultural conomy M → omain-specific, unique IP
-  utoML → Significant optimization, competitive with H2O
-  LLM Narratives → GPT-4 integration + fact-checking, unique
-  RIM-LSTM Hybrid → Research-level innovation

## Migration Path (reemium unnel)

```

  Step : iscovery (Open Source)                            
  User installs krl-model-zoo-core from PyPI                 
  Runs RIM, Prophet, Random orest on sample data          
  Reads documentation, joins Slack community                 
  → , monthly users                                     

                            ↓

  Step 2: valuation (ree Trial)                            
  User signs up for LRX ashboard (4-day trial)          
  onnects real data, runs open-source models                
  Sees "locked" proprietary features (ensembles, M)        
  → , trial users (% conversion)                       

                            ↓

  Step 3: onversion (Paid)                                  
  User upgrades to Professional ($-2K/year/developer)     
  OR nterprise ashboard ($K-K/year/org)                
  Unlocks proprietary models, advanced features              
  →  paying customers (% conversion)                    

                            ↓

  Step 4: xpansion (ustom Projects)                        
  ustomer requests custom M or consulting                 
  KR-Labs delivers $K+ project                            
  ecomes reference customer, case study                     
  →  enterprise customers                                  

```

**onversion Rates:**
- Open-source users → Trial: % (industry standard for developer tools)
- Trial → Paid: % (typical SaaS conversion)
- Paid → nterprise: % (expansion revenue)

**Unit conomics:**
-  (ustomer cquisition ost): $ (content marketing, conferences)
- LTV (Lifetime Value): $, (3 years × $K average annual spend)
- LTV/ Ratio: 3: (excellent for SaaS)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Open-source models cannibalize proprietary sales
**Mitigation:**
- lear value differentiation (basic vs advanced)
- nterprise features (auth, collaboration, branding) only in proprietary
- Open models intentionally limited (e.g., basic i, not staggered i)
- ashboard "locked features" drive upgrade conversions

### Risk: ompetitors fork open-source code
**Mitigation:**
- MIT license allows forking (can't prevent)
- ompetitive advantage: integration, documentation, support, dashboard
- Proprietary models remain closed (competitive moat)
- Network effects: community contributions improve open-source, drive adoption

### Risk: Users build own ensembles with open models
**Mitigation:**
- Possible but time-consuming (weeks of work)
- Proprietary ensembles are optimized, production-tested, UI-integrated
- utoML saves months of hyperparameter tuning
- nterprise support justifies cost for organizations

### Risk: Open-source models insufficient to drive adoption
**Mitigation:**
- Gate 2 includes 4 production-ready models (substantial offering)
- etter integration than statsmodels/scikit-learn (unified interface)
- Unique offerings (Location Quotient, shift-share) not available elsewhere
- omprehensive documentation & tutorials

## Q

**Q: Why not keep everything proprietary?**  
: Open-source foundation drives adoption, establishes credibility, and competes with free alternatives (statsmodels, scikit-learn). Proprietary-only would limit market reach.

**Q: Why not keep everything open-source?**  
: dvanced analytics (M, causal discovery, utoML) represent significant R& investment that justifies commercial licensing. Revenue funds continued development.

**Q: an users achieve same results with open-source models?**  
: asic results yes (e.g., RIM forecasts). dvanced results (ensemble forecasting, M simulations, LLM narratives) require proprietary packages or months of custom development.

**Q: What if competitors copy the open-source models?**  
: MIT license allows this. ompetitive advantage: integration, documentation, support, proprietary models, dashboard, domain expertise. Network effects make KR-Labs the canonical implementation.

**Q: How do you prevent proprietary leakage?**  
: License enforcement, legal agreements, obfuscation (PyPI wheels, no source distribution), telemetry (usage tracking), and customer trust (reputation risk).

**Q: What's the upgrade path from open to proprietary?**  
: Same PI interface (seamless transition). Users can mix open + proprietary models in same pipeline. ashboard shows "locked" features to drive conversions.
